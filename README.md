# WHACK-A-MOLE-verilog
This project implements the classic Whack-a-Mole arcade game on the Basys 3 FPGA board to test a player's reaction time. The circuit will use nine onboard LEDs as the moles and the nine corresponding slide switches as the hammers. The game's operation is that a single LED (mole) will light up at a random position and then the player must hit it.
